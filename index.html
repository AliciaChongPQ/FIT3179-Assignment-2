                    <p>The disease presents with <strong>high fever, fatigue, headache, abdominal pain,</strong> and <strong>diarrhea</strong> or <strong>constipation</strong>. A distinctive rose-colored rash may also appear in some cases.<br></br></p>
                    <p><strong style="color:#755a85; font-size: 20px;">HEPATITIS A:</strong> caused by the Hepatitis A virus (HAV), which primarily spreads through consumption of contaminated water or food, particularly in regions with poor sanitation. The virus affects the liver.</p>
                    <p>Symptoms include <strong>fever, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain,</strong> and <strong>jaundice</strong> (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Hepatitis A is typically less severe than other forms of hepatitis but can still cause significant illness.</p>

                        <p><strong>Children</strong> are particularly vulnerable to typhoid because of weaker immune systems. They often face more severe symptoms like high fever, diarrhea, and potential complications if not treated promptly.</p>

                        <p><strong>Children</strong> often have milder or asymptomatic cases of hepatitis A, with many not showing symptoms at all.
                            Despite this, they are efficient spreaders of the virus, as they may unknowingly transmit it to others.</p>
                        <p><strong>Adults</strong> are more likely to experience severe symptoms. Jaundice, extreme fatigue, and liver inflammation are more common.</p>

                    <p>In such regions, people may also have <strong>difficulty washing produce</strong> or cooking utensils. This can contribute to the ingestion of harmful pathogens, leading to a higher infection rates.</p>
                    <p><strong style="font-size: 20px;">Water Treatment Plant Density</strong> has minimal correlation with the incidence rates of these diseases. This may be due to the fact that the <strong>quality and maintenance</strong> of 
                    these infrastructures <strong>play a bigger role</strong>.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, <strong>behaviorial factors</strong> may hold a bigger impact. Even with improved water treatment, if individuals continue to engage in practices that contribute to disease transmission (e.g., poor sanitation, or improper storage of water), the <strong>expected decrease in disease rates may not materialize</strong>.</p>
